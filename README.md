# COVID TO DEFENSE!!
too hard
two thousand and twenty
this year is zooming away
humor is getting us through
since were all in quarantine
were making inside jokes
at home all day everyday
the days blending together
the days start to feel the same
miss office space peoples face
my cooking has gotten a lot better
work from home study from bedroom
why did the chicken cross the road
because the chicken behind it did not
know how to social distance properly
